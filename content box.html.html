            Hong Kong became a colony of the British Empire after the Qing
            Empire ceded Hong Kong Island at the end of the First Opium War in
            1842. The colony expanded to the Kowloon Peninsula in 1860 after the
            Second Opium War and was further extended when Britain obtained a
            99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898.
